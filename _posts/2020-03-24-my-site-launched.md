Well, I think I want to get my linuxgeek site back up and running and start posting stuff. I'm currently doing SANS NetWars, have my SANS GSEC to renew in a few months and will be starting my OSCP on April 18th! This site is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. This is cool.
